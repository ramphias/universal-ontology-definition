# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-10 — Documentation Bilingual Overhaul & Cleanup

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **Removed `extensions/common/`** — The Common Enterprise Extension has been entirely removed from the ontology architecture to enforce stricter domain-specific extension boundaries.

### Changed
- **Documentation Overhauled (MkDocs)** — Completely refactored the project's documentation structure into `docs-site/` with native, section-by-section English-Chinese bilingual integration. The frontend language toggle has been removed for a unified reading experience.
- **Architecture Guide Restructured** — Split the monolithic architecture manual into dedicated, granular guides (`four-layer-model.md`, `inheritance.md`, `platform-bindings.md`).
- **README Redesign** — Modernized `README.md` and `README_CN.md` with beautiful shields.io badges, cleaner tables, responsive Mermaid flowcharts, and correct MkDocs documentation links.
- **Repository Cleanup** — Removed legacy static documentation (`docs/`) and private enterprise example references. Updated `.gitignore` to prevent committing `.netlify-deploy/` artifacts.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-03 — Anti-Entropy Refactoring

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **L1 Core restructured**: 25 classes → 24 classes (4 abstract domains + 20 concrete)
- **`BusinessObject` replaced by `Resource`** — all L2 extensions using `"parent": "BusinessObject"` must change to `"parent": "Resource"`
- **`DocumentRecord` renamed to `Document`** — all L2 extensions using `"parent": "DocumentRecord"` must change to `"parent": "Document"`
- **`Activity` class removed from L1** — now available in `extensions/common/` as a subtype of `Process`
- **Relations renamed/merged**:
  - `belongs_to` + `composed_of` → `part_of`
  - `is_accountable_for` → `accountable_for`
  - `constrained_by` merged into `governed_by` (generalized domain/range)
  - `supports` and `requires_decision` removed (expressible via other relations)
- **Classes demoted to L2 `extensions/common/`**: `Channel`, `MarketSegment`, `Location`, `Decision`

### Added
- **4 Abstract Domain Root Classes**: `Entity`, `Governance`, `Operational`, `Measurement` — organizes all classes into a structured tree instead of a flat list
- **`Resource` abstract class** — replaces `BusinessObject` as parent for ProductService, Asset, DataObject, Document, SystemApplication
- **`deprecated_classes` and `deprecated_relations` registries** — provides migration guidance for breaking changes
- **Schema lifecycle fields**: `abstract`, `status`, `since`, `deprecated_since`, `replaced_by` for versioned evolution
- **Relation metadata**: `cardinality` (1:1, 1:N, N:1, N:M), `inverse_of` for bidirectional relation declarations
- **`extensions/common/` L2 extension** — Common Enterprise Extension containing demoted L1 classes plus new universally useful classes (Contract, Report, Project, Stakeholder, Regulation)
- **`scripts/validate_governance.py`** — Automated CI governance validator enforcing rules G-01 through G-08
- **Governance Rules G-01 through G-08** in CONTRIBUTING.md — hard structural constraints to prevent entropy growth
- **`maxItems: 25` constraint** in core_schema.json — schema-level enforcement of class cap

### Changed
- **Relation domain/range generalized** — `governed_by` now accepts `Operational → Governance` instead of `Process → Policy`, enabling L2 reuse without creating duplicate relations
- **`measured_by` generalized** — domain changed from `Goal` to `Operational`, allowing any operational element to be measured
- **`consumes`/`produces` generalized** — range changed from `DataObject` to `Resource`
- **All L0 platform bindings updated** to v2.0 (OWL/RDF, JSON-LD, GraphQL, SQL DDL)
- **`extension_schema.json` `extends` field relaxed** — now supports both string and array format, enabling L2-to-L2 dependencies
- **`sample_instances` made industry-neutral** — removed retail/manufacturing specific examples
- **Consulting extension** updated to use `Resource`/`Document` parent classes
- **Luxury Goods extension** updated to use `Resource`/`Document` parent classes
- README.md updated with v2.0 architecture diagram and class domain table

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- **Repository Flattening**: Moved all core project files from `universal-ontology-definition/` to the repository root for better accessibility and cleaner structure.
- Updated `.gitignore` to include `legacy/` archive and improve environment file exclusion.
